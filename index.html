        <p>Hi, I am Andrew Lebon. I am originally from Southern Calirfornia. I have one child and have been married for
            8 years to my lovely wife. We lived in, Layton Utah for 6.5 years while I was working for West Valley City
            Fire Department. We have moved to Las Vegas, Nevada to be closer to family. This is my first semester back
            in school after many years and I am very excited to be back to learning.</p>
